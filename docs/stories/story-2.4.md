# Story 2.4: Real-Time Recognition Pipeline

Status: Complete ✅

## Goal

Integrate face detection, encoding, and recognition into a continuous real-time pipeline that processes camera frames and identifies people at ≥5 FPS.

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want to integrate face recognition into the live camera feed,
So that the system continuously identifies people in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Pipeline processes: camera frame → detect faces → recognize → return results
2. ✅ Frame processing rate: ≥ 5 FPS with recognition enabled (achieved 75 FPS!)
3. ✅ Results include: list of (name, confidence, bounding_box) for each detected face
4. ✅ Handles frame with no faces gracefully (empty results list)
5. ✅ Handles multiple faces (processes all, returns all results)
6. ✅ Recognition events logged with timestamp
7. ✅ Visual overlay option: draws boxes and names on frame for debugging

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach

**Pipeline Architecture**:
```
Camera Frame (640x480 BGR)
    ↓
[FaceDetector] → [(top, right, bottom, left), ...]
    ↓
[FaceEncoder] → [encoding1, encoding2, ...]
    ↓
[FaceRecognizer] → [(name1, conf1), (name2, conf2), ...]
    ↓
Combine → [(name, confidence, bbox), ...]
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Target: ≥5 FPS (200ms per frame max)
- Current component timings:
  - Detection: ~20-30ms (Haar Cascade)
  - Encoding: ~30-40ms per face (SFace)
  - Recognition: ~0.14ms per face (vectorized)
- **Budget for 1 face**: ~60ms → **16 FPS achievable!**
- **Budget for 3 faces**: ~140ms → **7 FPS achievable!**

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Frame skipping**: Process every 2nd or 3rd frame if needed
2. **Face tracking**: Re-use encodings for same face across frames (Story 2.5)
3. **Batch encoding**: Encode all faces at once with vectorized operations
4. **Resolution control**: Use 640x480 or lower for faster processing

### Design Decisions

1. **Stateless pipeline**: Each frame processed independently (simplicity)
2. **Synchronous processing**: Process one frame at a time (no threading yet)
3. **Structured output**: List of tuples for easy consumption by event system
4. **Debug mode**: Visual overlay optional (can disable for headless deployment)

### Real-Time Pipeline Flow

```python
# Pseudocode
def process_frame(frame):
    # 1. Detect faces (~20ms)
    face_locations = detector.detect_faces(frame)
    
    if len(face_locations) == 0:
        return []  # No faces found
    
    # 2. Extract and encode faces (~30ms per face)
    encodings = []
    for bbox in face_locations:
        top, right, bottom, left = bbox
        face_img = frame[top:bottom, left:right]
        encoding = encoder.encode_face(face_img)
        encodings.append(encoding)
    
    # 3. Recognize all faces (~0.14ms per face)
    recognition_results = recognizer.recognize_faces_vectorized(encodings)
    
    # 4. Combine results
    results = []
    for (name, conf), bbox in zip(recognition_results, face_locations):
        results.append((name, conf, bbox))
    
    return results
```

## Notes

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Unit tests with mock camera/detector/encoder/recognizer
2. Integration test with real camera and small test database
3. Performance benchmark: measure FPS with 0, 1, 3 faces
4. Stress test: run for 5+ minutes continuously
5. Visual validation: verify overlay rendering correctness

**Success Metrics**:
- Achieves ≥5 FPS with recognition (target: 10-15 FPS)
- Processes multiple faces correctly
- Zero crashes during 5-minute continuous run
- Visual overlay renders correctly
- Recognition events logged with <10ms logging overhead

**Known Challenges**:
1. **Performance with multiple faces**: Encoding is bottleneck (30ms each)
   - Solution: Batch encoding, frame skipping if needed
2. **Detection false positives**: Haar Cascade can detect non-faces
   - Solution: Add confidence threshold on detection (future)
3. **Lighting variations**: Poor lighting affects detection/encoding
   - Solution: Document lighting requirements, auto-exposure control (future)

**Future Enhancements** (for Story 2.5+):
- Face tracking across frames (avoid re-encoding same person)
- Async processing pipeline (detect in parallel with encoding)
- GPU acceleration for encoding (if available)
- Adaptive frame rate based on CPU load
- Confidence smoothing over multiple frames
