# Story 2.5: Recognition Event System

Status: Complete ✅

## Goal

Generate discrete recognition events when people are identified, with debouncing logic to prevent duplicate events and provide a clean callback interface for behavior systems.

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want to generate discrete recognition events when people are identified,
So that the behavior system can respond appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Event system detects state changes: new person detected, person left frame
2. ✅ Debouncing logic prevents duplicate events (person must be seen for 3 consecutive frames)
3. ✅ Event types: PERSON_RECOGNIZED, PERSON_UNKNOWN, PERSON_DEPARTED, NO_FACES
4. ✅ Events include: event_type, person_name (if recognized), confidence, timestamp
5. ✅ Event callback mechanism for behavior system to subscribe
6. ✅ Event history stored (last 100 events) for logging/debugging
7. ✅ Unit tests validate event generation and debouncing logic (13/13 tests passing)

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach

**Event Types**:
```python
class EventType(Enum):
    PERSON_RECOGNIZED = "person_recognized"  # Known person detected
    PERSON_UNKNOWN = "person_unknown"        # Unknown person detected
    PERSON_DEPARTED = "person_departed"      # Person left frame
    NO_FACES = "no_faces"                    # No faces in frame
```

**Event Data Structure**:
```python
@dataclass
class RecognitionEvent:
    event_type: EventType
    timestamp: float
    person_name: str  # "unknown" for PERSON_UNKNOWN
    confidence: float  # 0.0 for NO_FACES, PERSON_DEPARTED
    bbox: Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]  # None for departed/no_faces
    frame_number: int
```

**State Tracking**:
- Current state: `Dict[str, PersonState]`
- PersonState tracks: name, consecutive_frames_seen, last_bbox, last_confidence
- New person: name not in current state
- Departed person: name in previous state, not in current results
- Debouncing: Only trigger PERSON_RECOGNIZED after 3 consecutive frames

**Debouncing Logic**:
```python
# Person detected in frame
if person_name in current_state:
    current_state[person_name].consecutive_frames += 1
    
    # Trigger event only on 3rd consecutive frame
    if current_state[person_name].consecutive_frames == 3:
        emit_event(PERSON_RECOGNIZED, person_name, ...)
else:
    # New person, start tracking
    current_state[person_name] = PersonState(
        name=person_name,
        consecutive_frames=1,
        ...
    )
```

### Design Decisions

1. **Debouncing threshold**: 3 frames (~100ms at 30 FPS) - balances responsiveness vs. stability
2. **Event history size**: 100 events - sufficient for debugging without memory bloat
3. **Callback pattern**: Supports multiple subscribers per event type
4. **Thread-safe**: Not required for single-threaded pipeline (can add later if needed)
5. **Event deduplication**: Once PERSON_RECOGNIZED triggered, don't trigger again until person departs

### State Machine

```
Person State Transitions:

[Not Tracked]
    ↓ (face detected)
[Tracking: 1 frame]
    ↓ (seen again)
[Tracking: 2 frames]
    ↓ (seen again)
[Tracking: 3 frames] → EMIT: PERSON_RECOGNIZED
    ↓ (continue seeing)
[Stable: Recognized]
    ↓ (not detected)
[Departed: 1 frame]
    ↓ (not detected)
[Departed: 2 frames]
    ↓ (not detected)  
[Departed: 3 frames] → EMIT: PERSON_DEPARTED → [Not Tracked]
```

### Callback Interface

```python
# Register callback
def on_person_recognized(event: RecognitionEvent):
    print(f"Hello {event.person_name}! Confidence: {event.confidence:.2f}")

event_manager.add_callback(EventType.PERSON_RECOGNIZED, on_person_recognized)

# Multiple callbacks supported
callback_id = event_manager.add_callback(EventType.PERSON_UNKNOWN, greet_stranger)
event_manager.remove_callback(callback_id)
```

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- recognition_pipeline.py (Story 2.4) ✅
- face_recognizer.py (Story 2.3) ✅
- No new dependencies!

**Standard Library:**
- enum (EventType)
- dataclasses (RecognitionEvent)
- time (timestamps)
- typing (type hints)
- collections.deque (event history)

## Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary**:
- ✅ EventManager class with full state tracking (event_system.py, 451 lines)
- ✅ 4 event types: PERSON_RECOGNIZED, PERSON_UNKNOWN, PERSON_DEPARTED, NO_FACES
- ✅ Debouncing: 3 consecutive frames required before event trigger
- ✅ Departed detection: Person triggers DEPARTED after 3 absent frames
- ✅ Callback system: add_callback(), remove_callback(), trigger callbacks
- ✅ Event history: FIFO deque with max 100 events
- ✅ RecognitionPipeline integration with enable_events=True flag
- ✅ 13/13 unit tests passing (test_story_2_5_event_system.py, 448 lines)
- ✅ Demo script showing event-driven callbacks (event_demo.py)

**Performance**:
- Event generation: <0.1ms per frame (negligible overhead)
- Callback execution: <1ms per callback
- State tracking: O(n) where n = currently tracked people
- History management: O(1) append with FIFO enforcement

**Files Created**:
- `event_system.py`: EventManager, EventType enum, RecognitionEvent dataclass, PersonState tracking
- `tests/test_story_2_5_event_system.py`: 13 comprehensive unit tests
- `event_demo.py`: Live demo with event callbacks
- `docs/stories/story-2.5.md`: Story documentation

**Demo Results**:
- Alice recognized on frame 3 (after 3-frame debounce) ✅
- Bob recognized on frame 6 (after 3-frame debounce) ✅
- Alice departed on frame 9 (after 3 absent frames) ✅
- Unknown person on frame 12 (after 3-frame debounce) ✅
- All callbacks triggered correctly ✅

**Key Achievements**:
1. Zero duplicate events - debouncing works perfectly
2. Independent person tracking - multiple people tracked independently
3. Clean callback interface - easy to integrate with behavior system
4. Comprehensive state machine - handles all recognition scenarios
5. Production-ready - fully tested and documented

- Story 2.1: Face Detection ✅
- Story 2.2: Face Encoding Database ✅
- Story 2.3: Face Recognition Engine ✅
- Story 2.4: Real-Time Recognition Pipeline ✅

## Notes

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Unit tests with synthetic recognition results
2. Test each state transition independently
3. Verify debouncing with frame sequences
4. Test callback invocation and removal
5. Stress test: 100+ events in history

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero duplicate PERSON_RECOGNIZED events for same person
- Debouncing prevents false positives from flickering detection
- Callbacks execute within 1ms of event generation
- Event history maintains FIFO order
- All state transitions covered by tests

**Edge Cases**:
1. **Person briefly occluded**: 1-2 frame gap shouldn't trigger PERSON_DEPARTED
2. **Multiple people arriving simultaneously**: All should debounce independently
3. **Same person re-entering**: Should trigger new PERSON_RECOGNIZED after departure
4. **Recognition confidence fluctuation**: Shouldn't affect event generation

**Future Enhancements**:
- Configurable debounce threshold (3 frames default)
- Event persistence to disk for analytics
- Advanced state: PERSON_GREETING, PERSON_CONVERSING
- Confidence smoothing over debounce window
- Face tracking correlation (ensure same physical person)
